# Behavioral Cloning Project

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---

In this project, I apply deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.


Project contains: 
* model.py - script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py - script to drive the car
* model.h5 - a trained Keras model
* video.mp4 - a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap


### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md

The simulator can be downloaded from the classroom. In the classroom, Udacity has also provided sample data that can optionally be used to help train model.

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

```

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.

#### Why create a video

1. It's been noted the simulator might perform differently based on the hardware. So if your model drives succesfully on your machine it might not on another machine (your reviewer). Saving a video is a solid backup in case this happens.
2. You could slightly alter the code in `drive.py` and/or `video.py` to create a video of what your model sees after the image is processed (may be helpful for debugging).

### Tips
- Please keep in mind that training images are loaded in BGR colorspace using cv2 while drive.py load images in RGB to predict the steering angles.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* README.md summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

Images have been normalized. After that they are cropped to show feed only relevant information of the driving area. In order to augment the data, images have been also flipped.

Architechture used to train the model is described here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316v1.pdf \
Structure is shown below: \

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

In order to reduce overfitting, I added a dropout layer. 

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually.

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Collected training data contains:

1. Driving in the track normally.
2. Driving in the opposite direction normally.
3. Recovering the car from undrivable area.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that ...

Then I ... 

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I ....

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded one lap on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:
<p align="center">
  <img src="data/IMG/center_2021_12_12_02_22_31_102.jpg" alt="Normal Driving"/>
</p>

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to recover when driving off the road. These images show what a recovery looks like:
<p align="center">
  <img src="data/IMG/center_2021_12_13_05_57_13_954.jpg" alt="Recover1"/>
  <img src="data/IMG/center_2021_12_13_05_57_14_772.jpg" alt="Recover2"/>
  <img src="data/IMG/center_2021_12_13_05_57_15_669.jpg" alt="Recover3"/>
</p>

After the collection process, I had 9741 number of data points. I then augmented the data, cropped them, shuffled, and split into 80% for training and 20% for validation. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was Z since after that many runs loss haven't decreased. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
